      "summary": "A large fire occurred at the Convergent Energy and Power 'Solar-plus-Storage' facility in Chaumont, New York. The fire involved multiple battery containers and burned for several days, prompting a shelter-in-place order for local residents due to potentially hazardous smoke. This was the third and largest of the New York BESS fires in the summer of 2023, solidifying the governor's decision to form an Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group.",
      "root_cause_analysis": {
        "assessment": "The working group's investigation identified the cause as an external event. An energized conductor on an adjacent utility pole broke and fell onto the BESS container, causing an electrical fault (arcing) that compromised the container and ignited the batteries inside. The fire then propagated to adjacent containers.",
